					<p class="bold-start">Based on the manga by Akira Toriyama, the first episode of <a href="http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Z" target="_new">Dragon Ball Z</a> aired in Japan on April 26, 1989. Even after more than 25 years, the anime is still extremely popular, with <a href="http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Z_Kai" target="_new">a filler-free refresh</a> of the series that came out in 2009 and <a href="http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Z_Kai" target="_new">a follow-up series</a> airing right now.</p>
					<p>Dragon Ball Z follows Goku and his family & friends as they fight ever more powerful foes that want to rule the Universe / want to show they're the best / destroy Earth. Being a <i>fighting</i> anime many battles take place during the 291 episodes. Characters get stronger through battles and training. A typical aspect of DBZ is that sudden increases of power can be unlocked through transformations, the different <a href="http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Super_Saiyan" target="_new"><i>Super Saiyan</i></a> levels being the most well known. The first person to unlock a new transformation often achieves this through an intense event, such as the death of a friend in battle. Although successive characters typically manage to achieve the same level with less effort.</p>

						<p>By following characters from fight to fight you can recognize distinct moments from Dragon Ball Z. Goku, although appearing in most fights overall, is still missing in action for very large periods of time. The reasons are the fact that he's dead during the start of the Vegeta saga, recovering from injuries (twice) during the Frieza arc, suffering from a heart disease at the start of the Cell arc, and, well, dead again during the start of the Buu arc.</p>
						<p>And, if you've seen the show, were you aware of how often Krillin participates in a fight? Or that Gohan doesn't actually fight a bad guy in between the end of the Frieza saga and when he snaps and turns Super Saiyan 2 at the end of the Cell arc? (that's more than 50 episodes!) Browse through all ±200 fights below to investigate the path of your own favorite character or, if you're new to the show, get an understanding of <i>DBZ</i> through its fights.</p>

					<p>The fight info was taken from the Dragon Ball Wikia pages for each saga. For relevance, a few fights were taken out of the above visual; the <i>Garlic Jr.</i> and <i>Other World Tournament</i> filler sagas were completely removed. Also the ±5 fights that happened in the anime only <i>and</i> didn't feature any of the Z fighters, happened in a nightmare or flashback were taken out.</p>
